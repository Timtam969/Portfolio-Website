        <img src="img/Portfolio_website.svg" alt="Portfolio Website Image">
        <p>
          I have been taking the Full-Stacked Web Develoment Course with Career Foundry and this has been one of the
          projects that we have been working on.
          It includes the basic code to create my portfolio Website, which will be continually updated to suit the new
          changes and skills learnt. Please feel
          free to have a look and I'd love to hear any positive feedback or ideas that you may have!

        <h2>Pokedex</h2>
        <img src="img/Pokedex.svg" alt="Pokedex Image">
        <p>
          I created an API fetch with Javascript. Here the Pokedex can be used to search through all
          current Pokemon Characters with a search tab as well as opening a Modal with extended information
          on each Character. This was a fun project that brought out the ability of Javascript.
